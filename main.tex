\subsection{Learning}
\subsubsection{Collaborative learning}
\textit{Collaborative Learning in Music Education: A Review of the Literature} \citep{luce_collaborative_2001}
\begin{itemize}
    \item collaborative learning is defined by three principles :
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item "knowledge is socially constructed as a consensus among the members of a community of knowledgeable peers‚Äù
        \item "the authority of knowledge is shared among the members of the community"
        \item "interdependent personal relationships shape a community of knowledgeable peers"
    \end{enumerate}
    \item through collaborative learning, "students would thus become engaged in the exploration of the knowledge and processes involved in the evolution of a music that enlivens and motivates them to participate in music"
    \item in a collaborative learning environment, the responsibility of maintaining the integrity and vitality of music is shared between teachers and students as they form a "community of knowledgeable peer".
\end{itemize}

\textit{Collaborative learning in higher music education} \citep{gaunt_collaborative_2016} -
collection of research articles and reports on collaborative learning practices in higher music education. General observations drawn from the articles :
\begin{itemize}
    \item collaborative learning appears to help the participants reflect on and express their fundamental values as artists and/or pedagogues;
    \item contrary to expectations, individual art forms are not muzzled when engaging in a collaborative learning practice, but rather deepened through its experience.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Collaborative Learning with Interactive Music Systems} \citep{marquez-borbon_collaborative_2020}
\begin{itemize}
    \item four participants were given a newly designed DMI and put in a collaborative learning setup consisting of several workshops over the course of 6 months;
    \item the collaborative process allowed for the definition of learning goals by the team that both oriented and motivated practice;
    \item the group succeeded in developing common set of learning methods and techniques, thus acquiring a similar virtuosity on the instrument, as well as individual styles of playing, bringing complementary to each other styles.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Appropriation}
\textit{The Problem of DMI Adoption and Longevity: Envisioning a NIME Performance Pedagogy} \citep{marquez-borbon_problem_2018}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NIME's ecologically motivated pedagogy is oriented toward the design and the creation of DMIs rather than the development of musical performance;
    \item the authors suggest that the longevity of a DMI should be sought by questioning how well it connects with performance practices rather than how easy it is to adopt it;
    \item this questioning must consider the academic and professional communities that support those practices.
\end{itemize}
